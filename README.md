The well-known Stable Marriage problem involves pairs of men and women arriving on a remote island. 
The challenge is to organize the arrivals in a manner that prevents cheating among the individuals. 
The goal is to arrange them in marriages where both men and women are content and won't seek relationships with others introduced to the island. 
Utilizing a data table indicating the preferences of each man and woman, the objective is to solve this problem and create stable marriages for everyone involved.
